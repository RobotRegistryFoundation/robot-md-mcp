## Where this fits in the stack

This repo is the **agent bridge** — an MCP server that speaks the open [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) and serves your `ROBOT.md` to any MCP-aware planner. Everything else is independent; adopt one, or all seven.

| Layer | Piece | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **Declaration** | [ROBOT.md](https://github.com/RobotRegistryFoundation/robot-md) | The file a robot ships at its root. YAML frontmatter + markdown prose. Declares identity, capabilities, safety gates. Spec + Python CLI (`init`, `validate`, `calibrate`, `register`). |
| **Agent bridge** ← *this* | [robot-md-mcp](https://github.com/RobotRegistryFoundation/robot-md-mcp) | **MCP server** that exposes a `ROBOT.md` as 4 MCP resources (`frontmatter`, `capabilities`, `safety`, `body`) + 2 tools (`validate`, `render`). One `claude mcp add` away. |
| **Gateway / Enforcement (Layer 3)** | [robot-md-gateway](https://github.com/RobotRegistryFoundation/robot-md-gateway) | Mandatory exclusive path between agent intent and any actuator. Receives signed RCAN INVOKE envelopes, verifies manifest provenance, applies tier policy + tool allowlist, dispatches to drivers, signs an audit-bundle entry per action. (Renamed from `robot-md-dispatcher` 2026-05.) |
| **Wire protocol** | [RCAN](https://rcan.dev/spec/) | How robots, gateways, and planners talk. Signed envelopes, LoA enforcement, PQC crypto. Think HTTP for robots. |
| **Python SDK** | [rcan-py](https://github.com/continuonai/rcan-py) | `pip install rcan` — `RCANMessage`, `RobotURI`, `ConfidenceGate`, `HiTLGate`, `AuditChain`. |
| **TypeScript SDK** | [rcan-ts](https://github.com/continuonai/rcan-ts) | `npm install rcan-ts` — same API surface for Node + browser. |
| **Registry** | [Robot Registry Foundation](https://robotregistryfoundation.org) | Permanent RRN identities. Public resolver at `/r/<rrn>`. Like ICANN for robots. |
| **Reference runtime** | [OpenCastor](https://github.com/craigm26/OpenCastor) | Open-source robot runtime — connects LLM brains to hardware bodies. One implementation of RCAN. |

## What it does

Reads a local `ROBOT.md` and exposes it to an MCP client as:

- **Resources** — the client can read at will:
  - `robot-md://<robot_name>/frontmatter` (`application/json`)
  - `robot-md://<robot_name>/capabilities` (`application/json`)
  - `robot-md://<robot_name>/safety` (`application/json`)
  - `robot-md://<robot_name>/body` (`text/markdown`)
- **Tools** — the client invokes on operator request:
  - `validate` → `{ ok, summary, errors }`
  - `render` → canonical YAML of the frontmatter

The server re-reads the file on every call. No cache, no watcher, no runtime config.

## Who uses this — three examples

Real operator workflows the plugin was designed for. Each example is a single Claude Code session after `/plugin install robot-md`.

### Example 1 — First-time hobbyist with an SO‑ARM101

A maker just assembled their first robot arm and wants Claude to drive it safely.

```
$ pip install robot-md && robot-md init my-arm --preset so-arm101 \
    --manufacturer "Home Lab" --contact-email me@example.com
$ cd my-arm && claude
```

Inside Claude Code:

> **Operator:** what can this robot do?
>
> **Claude:** *(reads `robot-md://my-arm/capabilities` via MCP)* my-arm is a 6‑DOF SO‑ARM101 with five capabilities: `arm.pick`, `arm.place`, `arm.reach`, `vision.describe`, `status.report`. Max payload 0.5 kg. Software E‑stop at 100 ms.
>
> **Operator:** pick up the red block and put it in the bowl
>
> **Claude:** *(reads `/safety` first)* The `arm.pick` capability has an HITL gate requiring explicit authorization for destructive scopes. The bowl-placement isn't destructive — I can proceed without extra auth. Running now.

**What the plugin does here:** the `using-robot-md` skill blocks answering from general robotics priors (the operator's declared 0.5 kg payload overrides Claude's training-data assumptions), enforces a safety-read before any motion, and routes capability questions to MCP resources instead of guessing.

### Example 2 — Safety review before a sensitive action

A clinical-lab operator is about to let Claude manipulate a glass vial. They want an explicit safety check, not a generic answer.

> **Operator:** /check-safety action="pick up the glass vial near the centrifuge"
>
> **Claude:** *(invokes the `check-safety` MCP prompt, which cross-references declared `hitl_gates[]`)* ⚠ **Authorization required.** Your manifest declares a gate named `fragile-objects` with `require_auth: true` for scopes matching "glass" and "vial". The gate requires your explicit "yes, authorize" before any motion. I won't proceed until you confirm.
>
> **Operator:** yes, authorize the pick — the vial is capped and empty
>
> **Claude:** Acknowledged. Executing `arm.pick` with the authorized scope.

**What the plugin does here:** the `/check-safety` slash command (an MCP prompt, not a hallucinated protocol) gives operators a deterministic gate check. The skill's rules ban Claude from silently proceeding past an undeclared scope; it either finds a matching gate or surfaces the gap.

### Example 3 — Team sharing a fleet-robot manifest

A research team has a shared repo for their TurtleBot-4 logistics robot. They want every engineer who clones the repo to get the same robot context in Claude Code without extra setup.

```
# From the team lead's laptop, inside the repo:
$ /plugin marketplace add RobotRegistryFoundation/claude-code-plugins --scope project
$ /plugin install robot-md --scope project
$ git add .claude/settings.json && git commit -m "chore: pin robot-md plugin to repo"
```

Now anyone who clones the repo and runs `claude` inside it gets the plugin auto-loaded (`/plugin`'s project scope reads from the committed `.claude/settings.json`). The `ROBOT.md` at the repo root is picked up by the MCP server's cwd-walk — no absolute paths, no environment variables, no onboarding doc.

> **New teammate, first session:** what am I looking at?
>
> **Claude:** *(reads `robot-md://fleet-tb4/context` via MCP, skill fires)* This is `fleet-tb4` — a TurtleBot-4 warehouse logistics robot registered at RRN‑000000000412 (public record: robotregistryfoundation.org/r/RRN-000000000412). It has six capabilities, two active HITL gates (shelf-height > 2 m, and any motion near the charging dock), and a 4‑hour battery runtime. What do you want to work on?

**What the plugin does here:** project-scoped install means the robot context travels with the repo. New teammates get identical agent behavior on day one. The registered RRN gives every surface (Code, Desktop, Mobile) the same public identity to anchor against.

## REST + OpenAPI bridge — `robot-md-http` (v0.1, scaffolding)

For agents that don't speak MCP (ChatGPT Custom GPT Actions, OpenAI Agents SDK, n8n, Zapier, plain curl) the same package now ships a Hono-based HTTP bridge that mirrors the MCP tool surface. Localhost-only, `npx`-launched per project, same posture as the MCP server.

```bash
npx -y robot-md-http /path/to/ROBOT.md
# robot-md-http: serving bob on http://localhost:8787
#   OpenAPI 3.1: http://localhost:8787/openapi.json
#   Health:      http://localhost:8787/health
```

ChatGPT Custom GPT Actions can import `http://localhost:8787/openapi.json` directly. Endpoints mirror the MCP resources (`frontmatter`, `capabilities`, `safety`, `body`, `identity`, `context`) plus `POST /validate` and `POST /render` tools.

v0.1 is a scaffold — see [issue #3 in robot-md](https://github.com/RobotRegistryFoundation/robot-md/issues/3) for the full v0.1 spec and the v0.2 hosted-multi-tenant roadmap (RCAN 3.0 envelopes, rate limiting, GPT Store entry).

## Not in v0.1 — deferred to v0.2

- No signature verification. `ROBOT.md` v0.2 will add signed manifests (`.sig`) and a key-binding-at-RRN-mint flow; see [`spec/v0.2-design.md`](https://robotmd.dev/spec/v0.2-design.md).
- No robot dispatch. `invoke_skill` / `query_status` arrive after the v0.2 signing decisions in §13 are finalized.
- No multi-manifest / fleet mode.

## Claude Code plugin — the easiest path

The plugin bundles the `using-robot-md` skill **and** auto-registers this MCP server. Two phases: install the plugin once, then set up each robot project.

### Phase 1 — Install the plugin (one-time)

Inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add RobotRegistryFoundation/claude-code-plugins
/plugin install robot-md
/reload-plugins
```

**Scope** — `/plugin install` defaults to `--scope user` (the recommended choice for most people). Other scopes:

| Scope | When to use | Command |
|---|---|---|
| **`user`** (default, recommended) | Your own machine, every project you open. Install once and forget. | `/plugin install robot-md` |
| `project` | Your team's repo — pin the plugin in `.claude/settings.json` so everyone who opens the repo gets it automatically. Commit the settings file. | `/plugin install robot-md --scope project` |
| `local` | Your personal override inside a project (writes to `.claude/settings.local.json`, not committed). Rare. | `/plugin install robot-md --scope local` |

The same `--scope` flag works on `/plugin marketplace add`. Match the scopes: if the plugin is `project`-scoped, the marketplace should be too, otherwise teammates won't find it.

### Phase 2 — Set up a robot project (per project)

```bash
# If you don't have one yet, create a ROBOT.md:
pip install robot-md
robot-md init my-robot --preset so-arm101 --manufacturer Acme --contact-email you@example.com

# Then launch Claude Code from the project root:
cd path/to/my-robot
claude
```

Inside the session, run `/mcp` — you should see `robot-md` connected. Ask "what can this robot do?" and the `using-robot-md` skill fires, reading capabilities from the MCP server.

**How the MCP server finds your ROBOT.md:** it walks up from the directory you launched Claude Code in, picks the first `ROBOT.md` it finds, and serves that. Launch from the project root and it just works — no config, no env vars.

**Registering a real robot** (optional): once validated, `robot-md register ROBOT.md --manufacturer <...> --contact-email <...>` mints an RRN at [Robot Registry Foundation](https://robotregistryfoundation.org) and pins `metadata.rrn` in your file.

Prefer the plain `claude mcp add` flow below if you need to pin a specific absolute path, run against multiple `ROBOT.md` files from one session, or install without a marketplace.

---

## Claude Code (CLI) — one command

The fastest way. One line, no config files:

```bash
claude mcp add robot-md -- npx -y robot-md-mcp /absolute/path/to/ROBOT.md
```

That's it. Open Claude Code — it now reads your robot's frontmatter, capabilities, safety block, and prose body as MCP resources, and can invoke the `validate` and `render` tools on request. **No harness config, no provider setup, no YAML wrangling.**

To confirm it's wired up:

```bash
claude mcp list | grep robot-md
```

To remove: `claude mcp remove robot-md`.

## Install (standalone)

If you want to run the server yourself:

```bash
npx robot-md-mcp /path/to/ROBOT.md
```

Node 18.20+ required. The `claude mcp add` flow above uses `npx` under the hood, so no global install needed for the Claude Code path.

## Claude Desktop config

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "robot-md": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "robot-md-mcp", "/absolute/path/to/ROBOT.md"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. Open a new chat — Claude now has the robot's frontmatter, capabilities, safety block, and prose body on tap.

## Any MCP-aware agent harness

ROBOT.md is a file. `robot-md-mcp` is an MCP server. MCP is an [open standard](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Any agent tool that speaks MCP can ingest ROBOT.md through this server — not just Claude.

The underlying command to register is always the same:

```
npx -y robot-md-mcp /absolute/path/to/ROBOT.md
```

Stdio transport, no auth. How you wire it depends on the harness:

| Harness | How to add |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code** (CLI) | `claude mcp add robot-md -- npx -y robot-md-mcp /path/to/ROBOT.md` |
| **Claude Desktop** | JSON snippet in `claude_desktop_config.json` (see above) |
| **OpenAI** (Codex CLI, ChatGPT Desktop) | Add to the tool's MCP-server config — command `npx`, args `["-y","robot-md-mcp","/path/to/ROBOT.md"]` |
| **Google Gemini CLI** | Add to `~/.gemini/settings.json` under `mcpServers` with the command above |
| **Cursor / Zed / Cline / Continue.dev / VS Code MCP extensions** | Add via the tool's MCP settings with the same command |
| **Anything else speaking MCP stdio** | Register the `npx` command; that's it |

Create and place one ROBOT.md. Any agent — any provider — reads the same file. That's the whole point.

## Tier-0 adoption loop

```bash
# Generate a draft from visible hardware
pip install robot-md
robot-md autodetect --write ./ROBOT.md

# Edit the TODOs (robot name, physics type, DoF, capabilities)
# Then point Claude Desktop at it:
# -> add the JSON snippet above to claude_desktop_config.json
```

## API surface

```ts
import {
  // Core
  parseRobotMd,
  ParseError,
  validateParsed,
  renderYaml,
  createServer,
  VERSION,
  // Types
  type ParsedRobotMd,
  type ValidateResult,
  type ServerHandle,
} from "robot-md-mcp";
```

All are importable for programmatic use — e.g. building a custom MCP server on top, or running the parser/validator as part of a larger TypeScript tool.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RobotRegistryFoundation/robot-md-mcp
cd robot-md-mcp
npm install
npm test            # vitest: parser, validator, render, server, bin
npm run build       # tsup → dist/
npm run sync-schema # refresh bundled schema from ../robot-md
```
